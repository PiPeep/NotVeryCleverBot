NotVeryCleverBot
================

This is just a test of an idea. This records the top replies to the top comments
on reddit, and then plays them back to other users on reddit saying exactly the
same thing. It's just like `Trapped_in_Reddit`, but with comments!

You can [see it in action here](http://www.reddit.com/user/NotVeryCleverBot/).

Coffeescript Rewrite
--------------------

The current version in master works, but is less than ideal, as it was written
in a bit of a rush. This is a re-implementation, now that I know what I want and
have the time to write it.

Installing and Running
----------------------

1.  Install `nodejs` and `npm` (duh!)
2.  Install dependencies with: `npm install`
3.  `./node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee src/main.coffee`
